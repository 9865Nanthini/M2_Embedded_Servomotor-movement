# SERVOMOTOR
A servo motor is a rotational or translational motor to which power is supplied by a servo amplifier and serves to apply torque or force to a mechanical system, such as an actuator or brake. Servo motors allow for precise control in terms of angular position, acceleration, and velocity. This type of motor is associated with a closed-loop control system. A closed-loop control system considers the current output and alters it to the desired condition. The control action in these systems is based on the output of the motor. It uses a positive feedback system to control the motion and final position of the shaft.

There are two types of current flow in these motors – AC and DC. AC servo motors can handle higher current surges and are thus more commonly found in heavy industrial machinery. ISL’s DC Servo Motors are best suited for smaller applications and have excellent control-ability and feedback.
